# VisualKDP

Visual KDP is intended to be a python backend for simulations done with Klein's optical design software (www.ecalculations.com, KDP-2).
As such it serves as a playground for KDP. Functions are provided which allow the user to set up optical system files and analyses as .dat files
which can than be input in KDP-2 using the command "input file filename.dat". The results can be loaded into python with special "read"-functions
for nicer visualizations with python. 3D visualizations of KDP optical setup files (parsed to pyrate) can be done with pyvista. 

Features will continuously be added by the author.
